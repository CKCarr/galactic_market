## Project Design Write-up
### What are we building and how does it fit the theme?

We are building an API that offers destinations to travel to, merchandise to buy, and experiences to have! It fits the theme because it's a way to buy tickets to explore the universe, and buy items from all around the universe!

### What tools will we use?

We have used Node.js, Express, MySQL, Redis, and Swagger. The backend serves as the core of our application, managing data related to travel packages, bookings, and user interactions.

### How long do we expect to spend on development of each part?

We wanted to spend a few days on each thing, but there were some parts we had to spend more time on.

### API Documentation

We used Swagger for our API documentation and it looks like this for example:
/**
 * @swagger
 * /:
 *   get:
 *     summary: Welcome message
 *     description: Returns a welcome message to the API root endpoint.
 *     responses:
 *       200:
 *         description: A welcome message.
